        <blockquote>
            In order to form a bond between some of the world's greatest nations we hereby join together and form an impenetrable alliance which the world will come to know as the region of United Alliances. We will form the branches of government&mdash;Executive, Legislative, and Judicial. Laying down basic rights and laws of the land, we will defend our member-nations through political, economic, and social union. To be civil in our diplomatic matters we will seek peace and reconciliation before war and destruction. <span style="font-style: oblique;">As we form this constitution, we form our bond.</span>

            <h3>a.k.a. The Executive Powers Amendment</h3>
            <p>There exists solely for the Founder, the privilege of executive authority. This power can not be disputed unless a law is broken that the founder does not have immunity for. The process to challenge immunity can only occur if impeachment procedures commence.</p> 
            
            <p>The Founder, (using executive privilege) has the right to declare martial law at a time of emergency in United Alliances; with martial law the founder has an irrevocable license to rule, unchallenged (for up to 14 days, and then the founder must receive permission from the Union Assembly - simple majority will suffice).</p> 
            
            <p>During martial law, the founder may consult with the general of United Alliances Armed Forces. It is up to the discretion of the founder alone to heed any advice given by the general or convening councils/tribunals.</p> 
            
            <p>The Founder can request there be made changes to the Constitution at any time with 2/3 majority approval of the Union Assembly.</p>
